# so_long
A simple 2D game, made with the MLX42 graphics library.

A project from Hive Helsinki. Compiled with make. In order to compile
successfully, you'll also need cmake and glfw installed. The graphics library
and all textures are included in this repository.

The aim of this simple game is to collect all the collectables, and then
exit the map, in the fewest number of steps possible. The program accepts maps only
in .ber format, and will reject maps that are invalid for play.
